# Overview
meedee is a program that converts MIDI music sequence files into platforming stages, letting you play the file as you run through it triggering notes.

# How to use
## If you already have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed
1. install the pygame modules mido and pygame from the command line with pip install mido and pip install pygame
1. clone the repository 
1. run meedee.py
1. select a midi file from the file browser
## Windows
I have also compiled anexecutable with pyinstaller to run the program on Windows. Go to the releases section, download and extract the zipped folder, and run the executable.
